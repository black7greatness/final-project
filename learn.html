            <h2>PRE-COLONIAL AFRICAN POLITICS</h2>
            <div class="image image1">

            </div>
            <P>
                Pre-colonial history shows us evidence of progress because of African pioneering abilities, 
                but also setbacks because of the hard conditions people had to face in those days. People in
                pre-colonial Africa were engaged in hunting and gathering, agriculture, mining and simple 
                manufacturing. Agriculture involved most people, so the chapter looks mainly at farming activities.
                The chapter explains that farmers in those days faced two big challenges: a hostile environment 
                and scarcity of labour. In many regions the environmental conditions were unfavourable
                for production. And almost all regions suffered from a shortage of labour. We will see 
                that there were many different systems of agricultural production in pre-colonial Africa,
                to suit the variety of conditions the people faced. Africans were not passive victims of 
                these conditions. They were innovative and good at adapting. Their production systems had 
                to be flexible to deal with the existing conditions. Precolonial Africans could make an 
                impression on nature. As a Malawian proverb says: ‘It is people who make the world: the
                bush has wounds and scars.’ They were not, however, able to transform nature on a large 
                scale, since economic development was not far advanced in the pre-colonial period. Without
                modern machinery such as tractors, and modern inputs such as chemical fertilisers and 
                pesticides, they were to a large extent at the mercy of the land and the weather. Minor 
                temporary changes in conditions could have severe effects on people’s livelihood. In some 
                regions, for example, two weeks’ delay in the rains could reduce the crop yield by one third. 
                To summarise the livelihood strategies of pre-colonial Africa would not be easy if we looked 
                at the whole pre-colonial period, which stretches from roughly seven million years ago to the
                late 19th century. So we will limit our summary to the period from the year 1000 AD to about
                1800. We start in the year 1000 AD for four reasons. At this time the Islamic conquest of 
                North Africa was complete, marking the beginning of the cultural, religious and ethnic division
                between Africa north and south of the Sahara. At this time also the Bantu people had completed
                Sd important effects on production systems in pre-colonial Africa.

            <h2>POST-COLONIAL AFRICAN POLITICS</h2>
            <div class="image image2">

            </div>
            <P>The transitional process has registered important new shifts in African
                politics which ought to be acknowledged for their significance in Africa’s
                post-independence history. Of these shifts, perhaps the most important is 
                the embrace by most of the key players of a multi-party liberal constitutional 
                framework for managing political competition, the expansion and pluralisation 
                of the public space, the open discussion of strategies for governing national
                diversities, and the emergence into prominence of non-state actors. But these
                changes have also been tempered by the deepening socio-economic inequalities 
                occurring in most countries, the continuing toll exacted by the prolonged economic
                crises on the continent, the narrowing of opportunities for social advancement by 
                the deflationary macro-economic framework promoted by the international financial
                institutions, the stagnation of national economies, and the continuing incapacitation 
                of the state as a public institution. With the investments which have been made
                by various groups in the project of democratic reform failing to 
                yield some of the socio-economic dividends that could have been expected,
                it should not be surprising that across Africa, the citizenship question has
                emerged as perhaps the single most important issue around which the struggle for change has crystallised. 
                Within this broad question, the issue of youth disaffection has come to the fore. It is a question which 
                speaks to the fact that although the old, post-colonial model of accumulation and the social contract 
                that was built on it may have exhausted themselves, the new market-based model of development whose
                basic blueprints were laid in the structural adjustment model of the IMF and the World Bank amidst 
                popular opposition, is yet to serve as an acceptable or workable framework for the constitution of
                a new social contract. The question which arises now is that given the failure of two decades of 
                structural adjustment to stem the decline in African economies – indeed, the adjustment programme
                became part and parcel of the dynamics of the continent’s economic crises – is it capable of 
                being a basis for the construction of a new social contract or must the continent now simply 
                count the costs of its maladjustment and develop an alternative framework for its development? 
                This is both a research and policy question and it is one which scholars like Mkandawire have
                recently been addressing through their arguments for a project of developmental democracy asS
                a framework for restoring Africa to a path of economic growth that is also by definition
                socially inclusive and democratic. It is an issue to which students should be encouraged
                to pay closer attention through the investment of theoretical and empirical
                 effort in the hope that such an investment can enable us to go beyond the morass into which African Studies finds itself.

                The ethnic groups of Africa number in the thousands, with each population generally having 
                its own language (or dialect of a language) and culture. The ethnolinguistic groups include
                 various Afroasiatic, Khoisan, Niger-Congo and Nilo-Saharan populations.
                The official population count of the various ethnic groups in Africa is highly uncertain, 
                both due to limited infrastructure to perform censuses and due to the rapid population growth.
                 There have also been accusations of deliberate misreporting in order to give selected 
                 ethnicities numerical superiority (as in the case of Nigeria's Hausa, Fulani, Yoruba
                 and Igbo people).
                A 2009 genetic clustering study, which genotyped 1327 polymorphic markers in various 
                African populations, identified six ancestral clusters. The clustering corresponded 
                closely with ethnicity, culture and language. A 2018 whole genome sequencing study of the
                 world's populations observed similar clusters among the populations in Africa. Distinct 
                 ancestral components defined the Afroasiatic-speaking populations inhabiting North Africa and
                  Northeast Africa; the Nilo-Saharan-speaking populations in Northeast Africa and East Africa;
                 the Ari populations in Northeast Africa; the Niger-Congo-speaking populations in West-Central 
                 Africa, West Africa, East Africa and Southern Africa; the Pygmy populations in Central Africa; 
                 and the Khoisan populations in Southern Africa.

            However there are other people around the world with African roots. These are the African diaspora who 
            are the worldwide collection of communities descended from native Africans or people from Africa,
            predominantly in the Americas. The term most commonly refers to the descendants of the West and Central 
            Africans who were enslaved and shipped to the Americas via the Atlantic slave trade between the 16th and 
            19th centuries, with their largest populations in the United States, Brazil and Haiti. However, 
            the term can also be used to refer to the descendants of North Africans who immigrated to other parts of 
            the world. Some[quantify] scholars identify "four circulatory phases" of this migration out of Africa. 
            The phrase African diaspora gradually entered common usage at the turn of the 21st century. The term diaspora 
            originates from the Greek διασπορά (diaspora, literally "scattering") which gained popularity in English in 
            reference to the Jewish diaspora before being more broadly applied to other populations.
            Less commonly, the term has been used in scholarship to refer to more recent emigration from sub-Saharan Africa.
             The African Union (AU) defines the African diaspora as consisting: "of people of native African origin living
            outside the continent, irrespective of their citizenship and nationality and who are willing to contribute to the
            development of the continent and the building of the African Union". Its constitutive act declares that it shall
            "invite and encourage the full participation of the African diaspora as an important part of our continent, in 
            the building of the African Union".

            Here we identify three relatively articulated periods in the political economy of postcolonial Africa.
            The first, from circa 1960 to the late 1970s, was a period of state-led developmentalism enabled by 
            the long postwar boom in the world economy and the embedded liberalism of the Bretton Woods system. 
            A second period from circa 1980 to the turn of the new century was conditioned by the long downturn 
            in the world-economy and a neo-li beral regime of accumulation that sought to re-structure and re-integrate 
            Africa into a deregulated world market. The turn of the new millennium constitutes a new period in which 
            neither the deep structural springs of the long downturn nor the neo-liberal project as such have been
            overcome; but their impact on Africa has been relativized by the emergence of East Asia as the new center
            of accumulation in the world economy. The resulting de-synchronization of the long-wave rhythms of the 
            world economy has permitted a modest economic expansion in Africa within a largely extractive regime of 
            accumulation and a wave of new enclosures that are profoundly reconstituting the social universe of Africa's 
            primary producers. The article identifies three relatively articulated periods in the political economy of
